# Blue Dot Podcast

This is the very first web page that I have developed. It consists in create a landing page for a podcast channel based on a provided UX design in which we only are able to use HTML and CSS. The site was developed under the *mobile first* principle.

This is the first project out of three from the Full Stack Web Development course in [Acamica](https://www.acamica.com/desarrollo-web-full-stack).

You can wacth a **[Live demo](https://wgnr.github.io/blue-dot-podcast)**.
